OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT :EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

OBJECTIVE:
Start with a dataset of your choice and perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy,
and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations,
and outliers. Visualize your findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to
gain insights into the data.

Key Activities
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the structure of the dataset and summarizing its main characteristics.
Visualization: Creating plots and charts to visualize trends and patterns in the data.
Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests and building models to understand relationships between variables.
Reporting: Summarizing findings and creating reports to communicate insights.


Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

Key Insights
Price Trends: Analysis of how car prices vary with factors such as make, model, year, and mileage.
Depreciation Patterns: Understanding how car value depreciates over time and with usage.
Popular Models: Identifying the most popular car models and makes in the dataset.
Condition and Price: Correlation between the condition of the car and its price.
Geographical Insights: Insights on how the location affects car prices.
